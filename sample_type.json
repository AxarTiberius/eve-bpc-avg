Recent data from the peculiar warp paradoxes located in New Eden was used by the expert system to create this design. It is rumored that the expert system has subsequently had to be forcibly terminated and destroyed by order of CONCORD.","group_id":1950,"market_group_id":2002,"mass":0.0,"name":"Magnate Warp Convergence SKIN","packaged_volume":0.01,"portion_size":1,"published":true,"radius":1.0,"type_id":61861,"volume":0.01}
